I've passed my PhD defense! Starting in July 2025, I'll be working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School, working with Professors [Dylan Small](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/) and [Zhimei Ren](https://zhimeir.github.io/).
