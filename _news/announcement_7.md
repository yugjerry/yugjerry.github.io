Now accepted to **NeurIPS 2025**: [multi-modal contrastive learning adapts to intrinsic dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12473). We present a theoretical analysis of CLIP, showing how *temperature optimization* enables adaptation to the intrinsic dimension of multimodal data. 

A more recent work proposes [IndiSeek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21584) which learns **modality-specific** features that are *independent* of shared features.

See also our earlier work on [the phase transition of projection heads in SSL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03335).
