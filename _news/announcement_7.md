New preprint: [multi-modal contrastive learning adapts to intrinsic dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12473). We present a theoretical analysis of CLIP, showing how temperature optimization enables adaptation to the intrinsic dimension of multimodal data. See also our earlier work on [the phase transition of projection heads in SSL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03335).
