A new preprint [iso-DRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06867) on how to utilize *side information (e.g. shape constraints)* to balance the misspecification of sample reweighting and the over-pessimism of distributionally robust learning! As an application, iso-DRL suggests a robust approach to calibrate estimated density ratios in reweighting approaches.
