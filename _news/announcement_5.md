A new preprint [iso-DRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06867) on how to utilize side information (e.g. shape constraints) to relieve the over-conservativeness of distributionally robust learning! More specifically, we propose a robust approach to calibrate estimated density ratios in weighted conformal prediction.
