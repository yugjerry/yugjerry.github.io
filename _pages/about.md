I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rina Foygel Barber](https://rinafb.github.io/) and Professor [Cong Ma](https://congma1028.github.io/).

My research broadly focuses on theory and methodology in scenarios where the distribution is weakly specified or fully supervised data is unavailable.

Prior to PhD, I graduated from School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China and was a student research intern advised by Professor [Jun S Liu](https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/) at Harvard.
