I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor [Dylan Small](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/) and Professor [Zhimei Ren](https://zhimeir.github.io/).

I obtained my PhD in Statistics at the University of Chicago, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rina Foygel Barber](https://rinafb.github.io/) and Professor [Cong Ma](https://congma1028.github.io/).


Prior to my PhD, I graduated from [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at University of Science and Technology of China and was a student research intern advised by Professor [Jun S Liu](https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/) at Harvard.

My research broadly focuses on theory and methodology in scenarios where the distribution is weakly specified or fully supervised data are unavailable.
I am particularly interested in statistical inference with adaptively collected data, distribution-free inference under distribution shifts, and learning with multi-modal data.
